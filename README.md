# BRICK-BREAKER-GAME
Objective:
objective of this project is to understand and analyse the basic concept of programming i.e logic building,function calling,branching, designing the control flow of the program using basic data structures to complex data structures.
Logic:The objective of the brick breaker game is to break the bricks that are distributed around the top of the game screen. The bricks are broken after coming in contact with a ball that bounces around the screen. At the bottom is a paddle that in the classic game moves based on user input. The paddle may move horizontally and is controlled with the Keyboard keys. The user has to make sure the ball bounces off the paddle without going off the bottom of the screen.
The Platform used for this project is Turbo C++. This project is based on C Programming language.

C Header files:
•	stddef.h – Defines several useful types and macros.
•	stdint.h – Defines exact width integer types.
•	stdio.h – Defines core input and output functions
•	stdlib.h – Defines numeric conversion functions, pseudo-random network generator, memory allocation
•	string.h – Defines string	handling functions
•	math.h – Defines	common mathematical functions

Functions which are often used:
•	kbhit() - Determines if a keyboard key was pressed.
•	cprintf() - Formats values and writes them directly to the console.
•	clrscr() - Clears the screen.
•	getch() - Get char entry from the console.
•	gotoxy() - The gotoxy() function is used to simply move the cursor on your monitor screen wherever desired.
•	_setcursortype(_NOCURSOR) - It helps to enable/disable the cursor on output screen.
•	textcolor() - It is used to change the color of drawing text in C programs Turbo C compiler only.
•	textbackground() - It is used to change current background color in text mode.
